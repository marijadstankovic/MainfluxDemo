Mainflux supports various storage databases in which messages are stored:
- CassandraDB
- MongoDB
- InfluxDB

These storages are activated via docker-compose add-ons.

The `<project_root>/docker` folder contains an `addons` directory. This directory is used for various services that are not core to the Mainflux platform but could be used for providing additional features.

In order to run these services, core services, as well as the network from the core composition, should be already running.

## Writers

Writers provide an implementation of various `message writers`. Message writers are services that consume normalized (in `SenML` format) Mainflux messages and store them in specific data store.

### InfluxDB, InfluxDB-writer and Grafana

From the project root execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/addons/influxdb-writer/docker-compose.yml up -d
```
This will install and start:

- [InfluxDB](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb) - time series database
- InfluxDB writer - message repository implementation for InfluxDB
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com) - tool for database exploration and data visualization and analytics

Those new services will take some additional ports:

- 8086 by InfluxDB
- 8900 by InfluxDB writer service
- 3001 by Grafana

To access Grafana, navigate to `http://localhost:3001` and login with: `admin`, password: `admin`

### Cassandra and Cassandra-writer

```bash
./docker/addons/cassandra-writer/init.sh
```
_Please note that Cassandra may not be suitable for your testing enviroment because it has high system requirements._

### MongoDB and MongoDB-writer

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/addons/mongodb-writer/docker-compose.yml up -d
```
MongoDB default port (27017) is exposed, so you can use various tools for database inspection and data visualization.

## Readers

Readers provide an implementation of various `message readers`.
Message readers are services that consume normalized (in `SenML` format) Mainflux messages from data storage and opens HTTP API for message consumption.
Installing corresponding writer before reader is implied.


### InfluxDB-reader

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/addons/influxdb-reader/docker-compose.yml up -d
```
Service exposes [HTTP API](https://github.com/mainflux/mainflux/blob/master/readers/swagger.yml) for fetching messages on port 8905


To read sent messages on channel with id `channel_id` you should send `GET` request to `/channels/<channel_id>/messages` with thing access token in `Authorization` header. That thing must be connected to  channel with `channel_id`

```
curl -s -S -i  -H "Authorization: <thing_token>" http://localhost:8905/channels/<channel_id>/messages
```

Response should look like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Tue, 18 Sep 2018 18:56:19 GMT
Content-Length: 228

{
    "messages": [
        {
            "Channel": 1,
            "Publisher": 2,
            "Protocol": "mqtt",
            "Name": "name:voltage",
            "Unit": "V",
            "Value": 5.6,
            "Time": 48.56
        },
        {
            "Channel": 1,
            "Publisher": 2,
            "Protocol": "mqtt",
            "Name": "name:temperature",
            "Unit": "C",
            "Value": 24.3,
            "Time": 48.56
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that you will receive only those messages that were sent by authorization token's owner.
You can specify `offset` and `limit` parameters in order to fetch specific group of messages. In that case, your request should look like:

```
curl -s -S -i  -H "Authorization: <thing_token>" http://localhost:8905/channels/<channel_id>/messages?offset=0&limit=5
```

If you don't provide them, default values will be used instead: 0 for `offset`, and 10 for `limit`.

### Cassandra-reader

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/addons/cassandra-reader/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Service exposes [HTTP API](https://github.com/mainflux/mainflux/blob/master/readers/swagger.yml) for fetching messages on port 8903

Aside from port, reading request is same as for other readers:

```
curl -s -S -i  -H "Authorization: <thing_token>" http://localhost:8903/channels/<channel_id>/messages
```

### MongoDB-reader

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/addons/mongodb-reader/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Service exposes [HTTP API](https://github.com/mainflux/mainflux/blob/master/readers/swagger.yml) for fetching messages on port 8904

Aside from port, reading request is same as for other readers:

```
curl -s -S -i  -H "Authorization: <thing_token>" http://localhost:8904/channels/<channel_id>/messages
```
